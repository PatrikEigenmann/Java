 * IVersionable.java - The purpose of the IVersionable interface is to provide a contract for retrieving version
 * information related to a specific software component. By defining a single static method, it allows developers to
 * dynamically obtain a version string based on the componentâ€™s name, major version, and minor version. This interface
 * doesnâ€™t handle the actual implementation of version control; rather, it serves as an abstraction layer for version-
 * related operations. Developers can use it to retrieve version details during runtime, facilitating consistent
 * version reporting across different components within a project. ðŸ˜Š

 * Change log
 * Wed 2024-08-21	File created														 				Version 00.01
 * Wed 2024-08-21	public static getVersion() implemented. Must be overwritten in implementing class.	Version 00.02
 * Wed 2024-08-21	public static getVersion(String componentIn, int iMajorIn, int iMinorIn)			Version 00.03
 * Wed 2024-08-21	final static int iMajor & final static int iMinor implemented.						Version 00.04
 * Mon 2024-09-23	Renamed the interface into IVersionable.											Version 00.05
 * Wed 2024-09-25	Rearranged the class to make it similar like the Samael Library in C#.				Version 00.06
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * To Do:
 * 
 * - Rename the Interface to IVersionable to be consistent with the C# framework Samael.					-> Done
 * - Rearrange the interface so the difference to the existing C# Samael framework is minimal.				-> Done
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
